# SmartShell

Working with a terminal can be difficult when there are so many functionalities to remember.
This CLI is a single-file C++ program that is meant to simplify command line shell operations.
Essentially a subset of bash but with assistance that increases ease-of-use and more intuitive command names.

Prerequisites:
- C++ compiler with support for C++ version 17

Future Recommendations:
- add more functionality (e.g. move, echo, cat, alias, etc.)
